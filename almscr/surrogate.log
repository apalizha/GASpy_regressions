===========================================================================
 This BARON run may utilize the following subsolver(s)
 For LP/MIP: ILOG CPLEX                                      
 For NLP: MINOS, SNOPT, GAMS external NLP, IPOPT, FILTERSD
===========================================================================
 Starting solution is feasible with a value of     487380.589208

---  The best solution found is:

Solution      = 4231.87606289  best solution found during preprocessing
Best possible = -1E51
Absolute gap  = 1E51  optca = 0.0500000007450581
Relative gap  = NA  optcr = 9.99999974737875E-5
  (Note that BARON uses a different formula to compute the relative gap as
   was used for the above reported value.)
